## Today
- Split navbar into desktop/mobile components with matchMedia detection and conditional rendering.
- Built mobile navbar UI (hamburger/center logo/actions, slide-in drawer, overlay, scroll lock) and refined shapes/icons.
- Added desktop navbar dropdown with caret and custom clipped green menu, plus restored desktop CTA background shape.
- Implemented mobile-only layouts for "What Problems NIT Can Help With" and "Healing Beyond Medicine" sections in `src/pages/Home.jsx` while keeping desktop intact.
- Tuned mobile typography and headers to match provided designs, including white subtitle strip styling.
